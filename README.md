# Week9_IP_KNN_NB


# The project is to analysis two dataset

Dataset 1 , the application of KNN model to predict the chance of someone surviing the tatanic acccident.
Dataset 2, The application Naive Bayes model to predict if the email is a spam or not spam .


# Research Question

Dataset 1: This analysis aims to develop a prediction model to determine whether or not a passenger would survive or would not survive the accident
Dataset 2: The goal is to develop a classification model that will classify an email as either spam or not spam

# Metric of Success

Dataset1
Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets.
For dataset 1, we will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then perform K-nearest neighbor classification.
For dataset 2, perform classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier.
Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification). Report the confusion matrix of each classifier. Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of the modeling.
NB/ The project will be considered a success when we are able to develop a reliable prediction model that has a high accuracy level. We shall make sure the model doesn't suffer from any instances of overfitting or underfitting

For dataset 2 
This project will be considered a success when we develop a classification model that has a high accuracy score 80% and above and does not suffer from any instances of overfitting or underfitting. The model's accuracy should also be assessed and optimized
